# Horiseon Marketing Code Refactor

## Purpose
Given existing source code (HTML, CSS), re-structure the language elements to follow a logical and orderly format.  Optimize the image elements with adequate "alt" attritubutes for search engine optimization.

## Built with
* HTML
* CSS

## Updates made to existing code
* Organized HTML code to make it more readable to the creator/editor.  This included adding text headers to each new section of code, semantic headings, proper class identifiers, and alt descriptions for the images.
* Linked the navigation bar elements to their appropriate section in the webpage.
* Organized the CSS code.  Added Text headings to each section, made sure the code matched the flow of the HTML sheet, and reduced the number of lines of code by using the class and ID tags in the HTML.

## Example of Updates to Code

* Organization of HTML code with text and semantic headings:
